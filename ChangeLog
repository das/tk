2001-09-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkGrid.c (ConfigureSlaves):
	* generic/tkPack.c (PackAfter):  Corrected type definition of
	argument passed to Tcl_GetStringFromObj() from size_t to int.
	Incorrect type broke [pack] and [grid] on systems where

2001-09-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/choosedir.tcl (DblClick): 
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (OkCmd, ListInvoke): Rewrote so as to avoid
	the highly confusing string "text" and to be consistent about what
	is and what is not a list.  [Bug 459895, reported by fandom]

2001-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c:
	* generic/tkImgPPM.c:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c:
	* generic/tkMenu.c: Applied patch [461578], provided by Vincent

	instead of depending on the tktest alias.

2001-09-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat:
	Apply binary property (cvs admin -kb) to files and convert

2001-08-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/menu.test:
	* tests/send.test:
	* tests/select.test: corrected to use testConfig constraints in
	the TK_ALT_DISPLAY case

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (ChooseDirectoryHookProc): work-around for MS
	bug that caused crashing in tk_chooseDirectory on Win95.
	[Bug #224936] (baker)

	ConfigureNotify requests were handled in relation to the parent to
	avoid the problem with potential 'raise' delays on some wms.
	[Bug #220260] (baker) wms that were affected should notice the
	difference in tests unixWm-51.* not failing that failed before.

2001-08-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/text.tcl (<Shift-Up> binding):  Corrected TIP 44 typo

	Windows as well and added some y padding between the buttons and
	the bar. [Patch #442835] (harrismh)

2001-08-20  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

2001-08-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkObj.c (TkGetWindowFromObj): Rewrote window code to
	reuse a previously worked-out set of window information exactly
	when the reference window is the same and no window deletions have
	occurred since the object was allocated (display has same epoch
	counter.)  Required changing the internal rep of the window quite
	a bit as now need to save three words-worth of information in the
	internal rep (this window, reference window, display epoch.)
	* generic/tkObj.c (SetWindowFromAny, DupWindowInternalRep,
	FreeWindowInternalRep): Code to support new internal rep for
	window objects.
	* generic/tkInt.h: Added epoch counter to TkDisplay structure
	* generic/tkWindow.c (GetScreen, Tk_DestroyWindow): Epoch counter
	is incremented every time a window is deleted.

	* doc/grid.n:
	* tests/grid.test:
	* generic/tkGrid.c: Grid configure rejected initial "x" and "^".
	[Bug #418664]
	
2001-08-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkObj.c (TkGetWindowFromObj): Was failing to reuse
	cached window objects, forcing a call to Tcl_GetStringFromObj and
	Tk_NameToWindow every time.  This fault has been in there for
	nearly three years...

2001-08-15  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: Labelled the TIP 44 changes as "POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY".
	Although technically internal changes are not incompatible, they'll
	be perceived as such by those who get bitten, and this will help
	them find the cause of their trouble.

2001-08-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tk{Util,Font,Cursor,Color,Bitmap,3d}.c: Modified
	objtype declarations so that they can be picked up in tkObj.c and
	the names are now prefixed with "tk" too.
	* generic/tkObj.c (TkRegisterObjTypes): 
	* generic/tkWindow.c (Initialize): 
	* generic/tkInt.h: Added code to register Tk's object types with
	the Tcl runtime.  [Tcl Bug 450545]

2001-08-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

2001-08-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/image2.tcl (loadDir): Converted non-portable
	[glob [file join $dirName *]] to [glob -directory $dirName *]
	which is both fully portable and more reliable when directory
	names contain glob-significant characters.  [Bug 223313]

2001-08-08  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/dialog.test:  New file testing [tk_dialog].

	* unix/tk.spec:
	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Bumped up patchlevel to 8.4a4 to distinguish
	CVS snapshots from the 8.4a3 release.  This does not necessarily
	mean there will be an 8.4a4 release.  [Bug 448938].

2001-08-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): added {unix,win}/tcl.m4 and
	library/msgs/*.msg to dist target.  [Bug: #448802]

	Thanks to Vince Darley for prompting another look.

2001-08-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/winMain.c (WishPanic): fixed CONST changes to go with
	CONST-ification in Tcl.

	* win/configure: regenerated
	* win/tcl.m4: fixed DLLSUFFIX definition to always be ${DBGX}.dll.
	This is necessary for TEA compliant builds that build shared
	against a static-built Tk.
	* win/Makefile.in ($(WISH)): added $(TK_STUB_LIB_FILE) to build
	target, otherwise it wouldn't get generated in a static build.

2001-07-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Subst DEPARG directly instead
	of relying on a variable. This will make Cygwin
	build faster since an extra exec will be avoided.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Subst DEPARG.
	* win/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

	the polygon difference of including points in the polygon even
	when fill is empty.  [Bug #226357]

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Remove PATHTYPE variable.
	* win/configure: Regen.

	backslash [Bug #438247]

2001-07-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): changed to use
	Tcl_EventuallyFree instead of ckfree so that widgets that have
	references to a tkwin can use them.

	* generic/tkCanvArc.c:
	* generic/tkCanvBmap.c:
	* generic/tkCanvLine.c:
	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c:
	* generic/tkCanvText.c:
	* generic/tkCanvWind.c:
	* generic/tkRectOval.c: corrected argument handling in
	Create<Item> functions that could lead to ABRs or FMRs and
	corrected names of argc/argv to objc/objv.

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (Mgetc): corrected screwy use of ternary
	operator and possible FMR.

	* generic/tkEntry.c: corrected missing Tcl_Release that caused
	font not freed complaints when trying valid cleanup calls.
	* generic/tkListbox.c: made use of Tcl_Preserve/Tcl_Release to
	prevent FMR errors in Display functions.

	* unix/tkUnixScale.c (TkpDisplayScale): corrected FMR when scale
	was deleted while calling its command.

	* library/console.tcl:
	* library/entry.tcl:
	* library/spinbox.tcl:
	* library/text.tcl:
	* library/tk.tcl: added private ::tk::GetSelection command to
	handle requesting selection.  This is to support requesting
	UTF8_STRING before generic STRING on Unix.  Changed Text, Spinbox,
	Entry and Console to use this command.

	* tests/select.test:
	* generic/tkSelect.c (Tk_CreateSelHandler, Tk_DeleteSelHandler):
	on Unix, a UTF8_STRING handler will be created when the user
	requests a STRING handler (in addition to the STRING handler).
	This provides implicit support for the new UTF8_STRING selection
	target.
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c (TkSelEventProc, ConvertSelection): Added
	support for UTF8_STRING target. [RFE #418653, Patch #433283]

	* generic/tkInt.h: added utf8Atom to TkDisplay structure.

	* tests/listbox.test: changed 'darkblue' to 'white' in a test

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Ditto.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Set CFLAGS to "" if the user

	* win/configure.in: Ditto.

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add resource compiler fix from
	8.3.3 to fix compiling with mingw.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4: Fix silly typo in last checkin.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	Set LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@. Add LDFLAGS_DEBUG
	and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to match the way CFLAGS_DEFAULT works. Use
	new LDFLAGS variable in the Makefile instead of @LDFLAGS@.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS to CFLAGS_DEFAULT, instead
	subst CFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile. Add AC_SUBST for CFLAGS_DEBUG,
	CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE, LDFLAGS_DEFAULT, LDFLAGS_DEBUG, and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE.
	Remove unused LD_FLAGS subst.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

	Set LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	* win/configure: Regen.

	several shades of blue, all of which were listed as RGB 0 0 0.
	[Bug #432104].

2001-06-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/selection.n: 
	* doc/clipboard.n: added SEE ALSOs to cross-reference selection
	and clipboard, with extra note for clipboard command in selection
	docs.  [Patch #422256]

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Corrected support for iso10646 (X11 Unicode)
	fonts on Unix. This adds a ucs-2be (UCS-2 Big Endian) encoding in
	Tk on Unix that is used for those fonts (X11 requires
	big-endianness). (welch) [Patch #406411; Bug #220890 #220899]
	This differs from the 8.3.3 patch by not adding ucs-2be in the

	TkWinXInit to TkWinGetPlatformId because static builds could call
	it before it was initialized. [Bug #427278]

2001-05-28  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* generic/tkFrame.c:
	* generic/tkWindow.c:

	BRANCH dgp-privates-into-namespace:
	* library/unsupported.tcl: New file for Tk's unsupported

	of ranges for "photoName data -from" subcommand.

2001-02-12  D. Richard Hipp  <drh@hwaci.com>

	TIP #21: Asymmetric padding in the pack and grid geometry managers.
	With this changes, you can now say "-padx {10 20}" to put 10 pixels
	of padding on the left and 20 on the right.  Similar rules apply
	for vertical padding.  See the revised documentation for details.

2001-01-02  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

2000-12-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/entry.n: Improved documentation of interplay between the
	  -state and -textvariable options.

2000-11-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/image.test (image-1.10): Improved this test, which
	  previously only worked if the command failed to delete the root
	  window, and caused *major* trouble otherwise...
	* generic/tkImage.c (EventuallyDeleteImage): Created this function
	  so that images that get deleted during the creation of an image
	  won't cause a nasty core dump.  Properly fixes bug #120819.

2000-11-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/image.n: 
	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Backed out previous change.
	  Bug #120819 is back again in force.  Left the test in there
	  though.

2000-11-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/image.n: 
	* tests/image.test (image-1.10):
	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Prohibited image names that
	  start with "." since they can cause some really obscure
	  crashes.  Fixes Bug #120819.

2000-11-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	Overall change:  Implemented TIP 5, which exports
	TkClassProcs/TkSetClassProcs as Tk_ClassProcs/Tk_SetClassProcs,
	adding a size field to Tk_ClassProcs to allow for future
	expansion, and renaming the geometryProc to worldChangedProc,
	which is more in keeping with the actual use of the callback.

	* unix/mkLinks: Added link for Tk_SetClassProcs.

	* doc/SetClassProcs.3: Documentation for
	Tk_ClassProcs/Tk_SetClassProcs.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c:
	* generic/tkEntry.c:
	* generic/tkFrame.c:
	* generic/tkListbox.c:

	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h: Regenned from tk.decls, tkInt.decls.
	
	* generic/tk.h: Added declaration of Tk_ClassProcs, with size
	field.  Added typedef's for Tk_ClassCreateProc,
	Tk_ClassWorldChangedProc, Tk_ClassModalProc.  Added definition of
	Tk_GetClassProc macro, shorthand for extracting a member of the
	Tk_ClassProcs structure.

	* generic/tkInt.h: Removed declaration of TkClassProcs,
	TkClassGeometryProc, etc.

	* generic/tkBind.c (Tk_BindEvent): Updated to use Tk_GetClassProc
	macro to extract modalProc; added check that the modalProc is non-NULL.

	* generic/tkFont.c (RecomputeWidgets): Updated to use
	Tk_GetClassProc macro to extract worldChangedProc; added comment
	about the choice of a recursive versus iterative algorithm for
	propagating world changed messages.

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_MakeWindowExist): Updated to use
	Tk_GetClassProc macro to extract createProc from Tk_ClassProcs.

	* generic/tk.decls: Added declaration for Tk_SetClassProcs.

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Commented out declaration for
	TkSetClassProcs, which is made public by this change.  The entry
	is left in place, but commented, so that future developers will
	know not to reuse it's stub number.

2000-11-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/ConfigWidg.3: Added deprecation note from Bug #120944 - use
	Tk_SetOption() instead.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (TkPhotoGetValidRegion): Applied patch to
	create this function and add it to tkInt stubs.  Should now be
	possible to write an extension that accesses the transparency data
	in a photo image.  Bug #120930

2000-11-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	8.4a2 RELEASE

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Initialize): added call to Tcl_SetMainLoop.
	This only has effect when tclsh is run (not wish), and then Tk is
	loaded in interactively.

2000-11-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinButton.c:
	* win/tkWinDialog.c:
	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c: fixed up code for Win64 support.  This mostly
	remains in _WIN64 #ifdef's, until updated compilers are standard.

	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/makefile.vc: updated for Win64 compile support

	* unix/configure:
	* win/configure: checked in configure scripts so people doing
	CVS checkouts aren't required to have autoconf.  Changes to
	configure.in in the future will require the corresponding
	configure script to also be re-autoconf'ed and checked in.

	* doc/event.n: added note that key events require window focus.

2000-11-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW, GetFileNameA,
	Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): created
	work-around for change in NT5.0/98 that caused no initialdir
	setting to open the browser up in the user's documents dir.

	* tests/color.test: marked color-2.6 nonPortable as we can't
	reliably assume what 'red' maps to.

2000-11-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/winDialog.test: Corrected expected results for bad option
	tests (5.2, 5.5) to include -multiple option.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Added branch for 0 return from
	CommDlgExtendedError() switches; this was formerly treated as an
	error, but it actually is not, since it just means the user hit
	cancel or closed the dialog.  (GetFileNameW): Added better smarts
	such that -multiple is not considered a valid option for
	tk_getSaveFile.
	Removed CommDlgExtendedError() checks for color and choosedir
	dialogs, and removed all except the explicit invalid filename
	checks for the file dialogs.
	
2000-10-30  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/configure.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rc/tk.rc:
	* win/rc/tk_base.rc (new):
	* win/rc/wish.rc: Added logic to derive filenames better in the 
	resource scripts based on compile options along with better
	support for building a static wish shell with cursor resources.

2000-10-27  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: added support for AIX-5.

	* tests/tk.test: 
	* doc/tk.n: updated to reflect default on status of useinputmethods.
	* library/tk.tcl: tk useinputmethods is set to 1 by default.  This
	enables Kanji and dead-char input by default.  Intro'd in
	1999-12-16 with default off to avoid some problems with older X
	servers that would slow down widget creation over time.

	* win/Makefile.in (test, winhelp, tktest): corrected the
	TCL_LIBRARY path specification.

2000-10-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDraw.c (RenderObject): Applied patch from [Bug: 6368],
	which corrects rendering of 1-pixel wide stippled lines on Windows.

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c (DisplayLine): Applied patch from 
	[Bug: 6368], corrects bugs relating to use of active- and
	disabledwidth values for displaying lines (disabledwidth was never
	used, and activewidth/disablewidths would only possibly be used
	when greater than default width, rather than when simply not equal
	to default width).

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (OkCmd): Applied patch from [Bug: 6365],
	which adds safety for directory names containing spaces or which
	are non-lists.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW, GetFileNameA, 
	Tk_ChooseColorObjCmd, Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): Added error
	checking for the return value from the common dialog functions, so
	that the commands will not silently fail if the common dialog
	returns an error. [Bug: 6369].

2000-10-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkConfig.c (Tk_InitOptions): Added
	Tcl_IncrRefCount/Tcl_DecrRefCount calls on valuePtr, to prevent
	memory leaks when the value object comes from the option
	database.  [Bug: 6275].

2000-10-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (cat32.${OBJEXT}): add win/ subdirectory to
	cat32 target to correctly find the source file.

2000-10-05  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_WinfoObjCmd): Added check for
	TK_ANONYMOUS_WINDOW flag in the [winfo children] subcommand; if
	set, the window will not be printed in the list of children.

	* doc/CrtWindow.3: Added entry for Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow.

	* generic/tkWindow.c 
	(Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow): New API for creating anonymous
	windows.  These windows are manipulable from C, but not from Tcl,
	because they have no pathname associated with them.  They are used
	initially by widgets that do rubber-band resizing (panedwindow,
	multi-column listbox, etc.), and may be useful for other widgets
	as well (dropbox, combobox).
	(Tk_DestroyWindow): Added check for TK_ANONYMOUS_WINDOW flag when
	determining whether to generate a DestroyNotify event.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: Regen'd from tk.decls.

	* generic/tk.decls: Added Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow declaration.

	* generic/tk.h: Added TK_ANONYMOUS_WINDOW flag for Tk_Window's.

2000-10-04  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/MaintGeom.3: Noted that Tk_MaintainGeometry handles direct
	descendants properly.

	* generic/tkGeometry.c (Tk_MaintainGeometry): Added a check for
	the case in which the slave window is a direct descendant of the
	master window.  In this case, we need not set up the additional
	infrastructure normally provide by Tk_MaintainGeometry, because we
	can rely on the parent/child relationship to handle it for us
	implicitly.  In this case, Tk_MaintainGeometry just calls directly
	to Tk_MoveResizeWindow.  This allows geometry managers to simply
	always use Tk_MaintainGeometry to maintain geometry for slaves,
	and avoid doing the direct descendant check themselves.
	(Tk_UnmaintainGeometry): Added a matching check for the direct
	descendant case; in this case, Tk_UnmaintainGeometry simply
	returns immediately.

2000-10-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): Added tests for -compound
	option, so that when there is a textvariable and an image, and
	-compound is not none, the button will display both the
	textvariable and the image.

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Added note that restoreProc and freeProc may
	be NULL.

	* generic/tkConfig.c (Tk_RestoreSavedOptions): For custom options,
	added test that the restoreProc is not NULL, to allow for custom
	options that don't care about supporting Tk_RestoreSavedOptions.

2000-09-29  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c: Changes to prevent a BadMatch error from the
	Xserver when the same bitmap is used on two or more screens of the
	same display.

	* tests/menu.test: Print a warning if the TK_ALT_DISPLAY environment
	variable is not configured so as to test for the bug fix above.

	* library/tk.tcl (::tk::SetGrabFocus): "Catch" the grab in case
	another application already holds the grab and the "grab" command
	fails.

2000-09-29  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: commented use of TESTFLAGS
	* unix/Makefile.in: added TESTFLAGS to test and testlang targets to
	conform with Windows makefile and TEA style.

2000-09-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkTest.c: Fixed tests to use updated API.

	* doc/SetOptions.3:
	* generic/tk.h: 
	* generic/tkConfig.c: Changed interface for Tk_CustomOptionSetProc
	and Tk_CustomOptionGetProc; these now take a pointer to the start
	of the widget record, and an integer offset to the slot for the
	option value, instead of just a pointer to the slot.  This allows
	more sophisticated options to do interesting things based on other
	data in the widget record.

2000-09-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tk.h: Added declaration of Tk_ObjCustomOption structure,
	used for TK_OPTION_CUSTOM, and typedef's of the functions
	Tk_CustomOptionSetProc, Tk_CustomOptionGetProc,
	Tk_CustomOptionRestoreProc, and Tk_CustomOptionFreeProc, used for
	TK_OPTION_CUSTOM.

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Added documentation of TK_OPTION_CUSTOM, and
	section "CUSTOM OPTION TYPES" explaining how to create and use
	custom options.

	* tests/config.test: Added tests for custom option type.

	* generic/tkTest.c: Added test support for TK_OPTION_CUSTOM to
	TestobjconfigObjCmd.  Added CustomOption* functions to implement a
	test custom option.

	* generic/tkConfig.c: Added new option type TK_OPTION_CUSTOM,
	which allows the definition of custom option types by creating
	parsing, printing, freeing, and restoring procedures for a custom
	option.  This is needed by the text and canvas widgets if they are
	to be fully objectified.

2000-09-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/Tk_Init.3:
	* doc/bell.n:
	* doc/loadTk.n: minor doc cleanup

2000-09-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/HWNDToWindow.3: 
	* doc/GetHWND.3: Changed synopsis to indicate the tkPlatDecls.h
	should be included, not tk.h.

	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: Removed #include <windows.h> for Windows,
	a better solution for now is to update the docs and have extension
	authors #include <tkPlatDecls.h>.

	* generic/tk.h: Removed '#include "tkPlatDecls.h"', as the
	incorrect inclusion order between windows.h/tkPlatDecls.h causes
	build conflicts on Windows.

	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: Added #include <windows.h> for Windows,
	so that HWND, etc., are defined properly.

2000-09-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/canvas.n: fixed doc bug (ellson). [Bug: 6218]

	* win/makefile.vc (install-libraries): 
	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries): 
	* unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Added tkPlatDecls.h to
	list of header files to install.

	* generic/tk.h: Added #include "tkPlatDecls.h", which declares the
	platform specific component of the public Tk stubs API's.

2000-08-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (DrawWindowsSystemBitmap): Use scratchDC
	for determining the source's logical coordinates.  Patch from

	under Windows NT/2000 in the same way as under Windows 95/98.
	Patch from [Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): Added a memset() to
	pacify memory checkers.  Patch from [Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::Update): Corrected
	handling of multi-pattern filters (eg, "* *.*"), which was broken
	by the getOpenFile performance patches applied earlier.

2000-08-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoGet): Removed redundant call to
	DitherInstance; this call was formerly being made from

2000-08-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/SetOptions.3: added missing ')'.

2000-08-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Updated documentation to reflect support for
	TK_OPTION_NULL_OK for TK_OPTION_DOUBLE and TK_OPTION_PIXELS.

	TK_OPTION_DOUBLE and TK_OPTION_PIXELS.

	* doc/place.n: Updated, reformatted manual entry.

	* tests/place.test: Added many tests.

	* generic/tkPlace.c (Tk_PlaceObjCmd): Updated to use Tk
	widget-option management facilities to manage place options (-x,
	-y, etc.), which simplifies the placer code.  Added support for
	[place configure pathName] and [place configure pathName -option],
	similar to the behavior of the configure subcommand supported by
	widgets.

2000-08-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/place.test: Extended test suite to test error returns from
	[place].

	Tcl_Obj'ified command.

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_BindtagsObjCmd): Tcl_Obj'ified [bindtags]
	command.

2000-08-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_TkwaitObjCmd): Tcl_Obj'ified [tkwait] command.

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Updated "tkwait" command entry to use
	Tcl_Obj'ified command.

2000-08-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkInt.h: Replaced prototype for Tk_MessageCmd with
	prototype for Tk_MessageObjCmd.

	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Added bits to change
	the indicator color when radio-/check-buttons are disabled.  This
	reduces the visual incongruity when a group of these controls are
	disabled together.

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (ReconfigureWindowsMenu): Added MF_GRAYED bit
	for disabled menu entries, to ensure that those which are drawn by
	the system are shown grayed (such as entries on menubars) [Bug: 4372].

	* doc/label.n: Added -disabledforeground to list of options [Bug:
	6053].

	* mac/tkMacDefault.h: 
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h: Added default values for listbox
	disabledforeground and state.

	* win/tkWinDefault.h: Changed default listbox background color to

	* doc/listbox.n: Added documentation for -state option.

	* generic/tkListbox.c: Added support for -state to listbox. [RFE:
	6052].

	* tests/listbox.test: Tests for listbox disabled state.

2000-07-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure.in: TCL_STUB_LIB_FLAG and
	TK_STUB_LIB_FLAG should not include ${TCL_DBGX}
	in win/tkConfig.sh, fix that.

2000-07-25  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* doc: CanvPsY.3, ConfigWidg.3, CrtImgType.3, CrtItemType.3, 
	FontId.3, GetFont.3, canvas.n, font.n, options.n, text.n:
	Documentation fix: Replaced references to XFontStruct *
	and Tk_FontStruct with Tk_Font.

2000-07-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/text.test: Added tests for -regexp -nocase searches with
	backslash character classes.

	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Text search did not work
	properly when -regexp and -nocase were used, in combination with
	backslash character classes represented by capital letters (ie,
	\W, \M); altered implementation of -regexp -nocase searches to use
	new regexp interfaces to fix this problem.  [Bug: 5988].

2000-07-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/text.test: Added tests for searching when text is elided.

	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Text search was not returning
	the correct index when the search covered (but did not search)
	elided characters; corrected this by adjusting the match index by
	the number of elided characters preceeding the start of the match,
	just as is done with embedded windows, etc. [Bug: 5470].

2000-07-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure.in: Add TK_STUB_LIB_FLAG and
	TK_BUILD_STUB_LIB_SPEC. These are needed to build a stub enabled
	extension.

2000-07-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tkUnixDraw.c (TkScrollWindow): Replaced a use of a trinary
	operator with an if/else, to avoid build problems on some
	platforms [Bug: 5819].

	* win/makefile.vc: Applied patch from Don Porter to enhance nmake
	support on NT/Alpha [RFE: 5939].

2000-07-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Enhanced <Tab> binding to behave like normal
	<Tab> bindings when the text widget is disabled (ie, it advances
	focus to the next widget).

	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Added a test for a NULL
	segment pointer when doing backwards searches for "" on an empty
	text widget. [Bug: 6007].

2000-07-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/aclocal.m4: Use tcl.m4.

	* unix/configure.in: Properly quote LOCALES variable. Properly quote

	so that it uses the TK_SRC_DIR in the same way
	as the unix version.

2000-07-17  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Added comments for a Win2K OS bug with
	GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE).  No change was done to the code
	as the resulting behaviour of ShouldUseConsoleChannel() was
	correct, anyways. [BUG: 5971]

2000-07-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkStubImg.c (Tk_InitImageArgs): Applied patch from [Bug:
	5990], from Anselm Lingnau, which correctly sets the value of
	useNewImage to 0 when the new image system is not to be used,
	instead of leaving it at -1, which causes the check to be
	performed more times than is really necessary.
	
	* library/bgerror.tcl: Fixed a typo in one of the bgerror dialog
	label.

	* library/msgs/it.msg: Italian message catalog, from Paolo
	Brutti. [RFE: 6012].

	Nijtmans.

2000-06-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/keysyms.n: 
	* doc/colors.n: Added extra .CE/.CS pairs to break up the large
	text block, so that the generated Windows help file could
	accomodate the manual entry. [Bug: 5862]

	* tests/filebox.test: Adjusted tests to accomodate -multiple.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Adjusted arguments list construction such
	that -multiple is not presented as an option for tk_getSaveFile.

	* library/tk.tcl: Added test for safe interpreter status before
	attempting to load message catalogs (which is impossible in a
	standard safe interpreter).  This means that SafeTk will not have
	localized dialogs, unless a means is found for loading the message
	catalog files.

2000-06-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/msgs/de.msg: German message catalog.
	
	* library/msgs/en.msg: English message catalog.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl:
	* library/xmfbox.tcl:
	* library/bgerror.tcl: Applied patches from Laurent Duperval to 
	provide localization of Tk dialogs. [RFE: 2671].

2000-06-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkMenu.c (DeleteMenuCloneEntries): Applied fix from
	[Bug: 5275], which corrected a segfault-causing indexing problem
	when deleting entries from torn-off menus.

2000-06-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: Updated with information about -multiple.

	* library/choosedir.tcl: Tweaked to handle modified tkIconList API's.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Preliminary implementation of multiple
	selection; based on patch from [RFE: 604].  Some of the tkIconList
	functions changed to support this and to make the dialog faster.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Added support for multiple selection, from
	patch in [RFE: 4999].

2000-06-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Corrected behavior of text widget with respect
	to this sequence of events:  click, shift-click.  Previously, the
	shift-click just moved the cursor and anchor; now, the shift-click
	will select the text between the click and the shift-click, which
	is the behavior most users expect. [Bug: 5929].

2000-06-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Added auto-truncation for long error
	messages (more than 30 characters wide, or more than 4 lines
	long), so that the dialog remains a manageable size. [RFE: 5782]

2000-06-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Patched to support tk_getOpenFile
	-multiple. [RFE: 604].

2000-06-13  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/aclocal.m4: 
	* win/configure.in: 
	* win/Makefile.in: Applied patch from [RFE: 5844], to provide
	support for the mingw compile environment for Windows.

2000-06-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	8.4a1 RELEASE

2000-06-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler and Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler to
	allow adding event handlers that invoke for ClientMessage events.
	This is necessary to support unix dnd protocols.

2000-06-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* canvas.test: added test for 5783.
	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c (DisplayPolygon): added checks for the
	polygon fillGC not being empty to prevent segfault. [Bug: 5783]

2000-05-31  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Improved bgerror based on work by Donal
	K. Fellows; no longer dependant on tk_dialog; features a
	Windows-esque "Details" button, and a customizable extra function
	button that allows the user to (for example) save the stack trace
	to a file.

2000-05-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Changed defines for GIF87a/GIF89a to be
	static char arrays with integer initialization, to address EBCIDIC
	vs. ASCII encoding issues and to handle compilers that don't deal
	with "\xAB" syntax for specifying hex values in strings.

2000-05-28  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/spinbox.n: (new file) docs for spinbox widget
	* generic/tkInt.h: added Tk_SpinboxObjCmd declaration
	* generic/tkEntry.c: added 'spinbox' widget - an extension of the
	entry widget type.
	* generic/tkWindow.c: added 'spinbox' to core Tk commands
	* library/spinbox.tcl: (new file) binding and helper procs for spinbox
	* library/tk.tcl: added spinbox.tcl to list of files to source
	* tests/entry.test: updated changed error messages
	* tests/spinbox.test: (new file) test suite for spinbox

	* generic/tkPlace.c (Tk_PlaceCmd): reworked place master/slave
	table init'n to prevent seg fault when using place on multiple
	displays.

	* generic/tk.h: added comments ot Tk_FakeWin structure

2000-05-26  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkOption.c (Tk_GetOption): Extended Tk_GetOption to
	support a new syntax for option names in option tables.  If the
	option name has an embedded ".", it indicates that the name field
	contains both an option name and an overriding widget class, in
	the form "class.option".  The lookup for the option value will be
	performed as though the widget class is that specified, rather
	than the actual widget class.
	(SetupStacks): Replaced several lines of array element copying
	with a for loop for conciseness.

2000-05-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/button.tcl: Tweaks for -overrelief handling on Windows.

	and radiobuttons.

	* library/button.tcl (tkButtonDown, macintosh version): Added
	protection against querying the -repeatdelay option from a widget
	that doesn't support it (ie, checkbuttons, radiobuttons, etc).
	Other platforms use a different binding script for checkbuttons
	and radiobuttons, so they don't have this issue.
	(tkCheckRadioEnter, windows version):  Added code to handle
	-overrelief for check/radiobuttons on windows.

2000-05-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -activeforeground, -activebackground
	for labels, for the -state option.

2000-05-17  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/bell.n:
	* tests/bell.test:
	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_BellObjCmd): added -nice option to
	optionally avoid resetting screen saver [Bug: 4279]

2000-05-15  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	callback to calling restack and focus code immediately.

2000-05-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	Overall change:  Added "-readonlybackground" option for entries,
	to enable a visual change when state goes to readonly.

	* mac/tkMacDefault.h (DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR,
	DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR):
	* win/tkWinDefault.h (DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR,
	DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR):
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h (DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR,
	DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR): Added default values for entry
	-readonlybackground option.

	* generic/tkEntry.c: Added -readonlybackground option, cleaned up
	excessive use of graphics contexts.

	* tests/entry.test: Added configuration test for
	-readonlybackground option.

	* doc/entry.n: Added documentation for -readonlybackground option.

	Overall change:  changed implementation of "link" relief for
	buttons.  Instead of a new relief style (-relief link), there is a
	new option, -overrelief, which if set is used when the mouse is
	over the button.

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Added information about TK_OPTION_NULL_OK with
	TK_OPTION_RELIEF.

	* win/tkWinButton.c: Removed bits about TK_RELIEF_LINK.

	* tests/button.test: Added tests for -overrelief; removed tests
	for -relief link.

	* mac/tkMacButton.c: Removed bits about TK_RELIEF_LINK.

	* generic/tkOldConfig.c: Removed bits about TK_RELIEF_LINK.

	* generic/tkConfig.c: Removed bits about TK_RELIEF_LINK; added
	support for TK_OPTION_NULL_OK for TK_OPTION_RELIEF.

	* library/button.tcl: Added binding support for -overrelief.

	* generic/tk3d.c (Tk_GetRelief): Added branch for TK_RELIEF_NULL.

	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -overrelief option; removed
	Enter/Leave EventProc masks and handlers.

	TK_RELIEF_LINK.

	* mac/tkMacDefault.h (DEF_BUTTON_OVER_RELIEF): 
	* win/tkWinDefault.h (DEF_BUTTON_OVER_RELIEF): 
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h (DEF_BUTTON_OVER_RELIEF): Added default
	value for the -overrelief option.

2000-05-16  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (ReconfigureWindowsMenu): Added code to add the
	MF_SEPARATOR bit for SEPARATOR_ENTRY menu items.  This causes
	separator entries on the system menu to be drawn correctly [Bug: 5451].

2000-05-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/image.n: Added documentation for [image inuse] command.

	* tests/image.test: Added tests for [image inuse] command.

	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Added [image inuse] command,
	which provides a means for programmers to determine if a given
	image is in use by any widgets. [RFE: 3327].

2000-05-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/clipboard.n: Added documentation for "clipboard get".

	* generic/tkClipboard.c (Tk_ClipboardCmd): Added "clipboard get"
	subcommand [RFE: 4628].

	* tests/clipboard.test: Updated to use "clipboard get" instead of
	"selection get -s CLIPBOARD".

	* library/entry.tcl: Adjusted Button-1 binding to set focus to the
	entry when it is readonly or normal.

	* doc/entry.n: Added documentation for readonly state,
	-disabledforeground, -disabledbackground.

	* tests/entry.test: Added tests for readonly state.

	* generic/tkEntry.c: Added support for "readonly" state, and
	redefined "disabled" state.  A disabled entry will display its
	text in a dimmed color and possibly with a different background,
	and will be completely unusable (no selection, no editing).  A
	readonly entry will look like a normal entry, but it will not be
	editable; selection is still allowed. [RFE: 4239].  To support the
	new disabled state properly, "-disabledforeground" and
	"-disabledbackground" options were added.
	*** THIS IS A BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE BEHAVIOR CHANGE ***

	* win/tkWinDefault.h:
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h:
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h: Added DEF_ENTRY_DISABLED_FG,
	DEF_ENTRY_DISABLED_BG_COLOR, DEF_ENTRY_DISABLED_BG_MONO.

	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton, TkpComputeButtonGeometry): 
	* mac/tkMacButton.c (TkpDisplayButton, TkpComputeButtonGeometry): 
	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpDisplayButton, TkpComputeButtonGeometry): 
	Added code for drawing compound buttons.

	-repeatinterval, -compound.

	* library/button.tcl: Added support for -repeatedelay,
	-repeatinterval options.

	error messages are used.

	* generic/tk.h: Changed values of
	TK_OPTION_LINK_OK/TK_CONFIG_LINK_OK for link relief support.

2000-05-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinFont.c (LoadFontRanges): improved support for all chars
	in 0-255 range for bitmap ANSI fonts.  May be improved to handle
	bitmap non-ANSI fonts in the future. [Bug: 2172]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (RaiseWinWhenIdle): added TK_DONT_DESTROY_WINDOW
	to flag check to prevent timing related core dump. [Bug: 5438]

2000-05-11  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinTest.c (TestclipboardObjCmd): ensured CloseClipboard
	would always get called for each OpenClipboard.

	* tests/focus.test (focusSetupAlt): removed wm withdraw from proc
	as it would cause a hang for tkwait visibility

	* tests/menu.test:
	* generic/tk3d.c:
	* generic/tkColor.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c: corrected handling of 3DBorder, Cursor and
	Color objects on multiple screens. [Bug: 5454]

2000-05-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/button.n: Added documentation for link relief.

	* tests/button.test: Added tests for link relief for buttons.

	TK_RELIEF_LINK, TK_OPTION_LINK_OK and TK_CONFIG_LINK_OK. [RFE: 4348]

	* generic/tk3d.c: Added support for link relief. [RFE: 4348]

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): 
	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Added support for link
	relief. [RFE: 4348]

	* generic/tkOldConfig.c (Tk_ConfigureWidget): 
	* generic/tkConfig.c (DoObjConfig): Added understanding of link
	relief, which is allowed only for widgets that have
	TK_OPTION_LINK_OK or TK_CONFIG_LINK_OK set for the "-relief"
	option. [RFE: 4348]

	* generic/tkButton.c: Added TK_OPTION_LINK_OK to "-relief" option
	for buttons. [RFE: 4348]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (EX_TRANSIENT_STYLE): Removed WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW
	style bit, so that transient windows have full-size titlebars
	(like the tk_getOpenFile dialog).

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (GetMenuSeparatorGeometry): Tweaked height
	requested for separator bars to be (linespace - (2*descent))
	instead of just (linespace); this makes the separator occupy a
	more correct amount of vertical space. [Bug: 5303].

2000-05-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/focus.tcl: fixed calling of takeFocus proc [Bug: 5372]

	necessary prolog for photos
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c: added Tk_PostscriptPhoto that outputs PS for

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c (Tk_MacGetOpenFile): Add empty bodies for the 
	"-initialfile" and "-defaultextension" options.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c (NavServicesGetFile): Only cons the result up
	into a list if multiple is true.

	* mac/tkMacMenus.c (SourceDialog): Use the "tk_getOpenFile"
	instead of hand-coding the dialog with StandardGetFile.  This way
	we get the Navigation dialogs for free.

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: Document the -multiple and -message flags
	which are only implemented on the Mac.  Also note that the -title
	works on the Mac with Nav Services installed.

2000-04-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/WinViewable.3: 
	* unix/mkLinks: Removed docs for Tk_IsViewable.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Removed calls to Tk_IsViewable.

	* generic/tkUtil.c: 
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkCmds.c: 
	* generic/tk.decls: Removed Tk_IsViewable function (it was not
	actually needed).

2000-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/aclocal.m4: made SC_PROG_TCLSH search specifically for
	tclsh*.exe type files to find an executable.

	* win/Makefile.in: fixed up cleanup, winhelp, cat32 targets

	* library/console.tcl: made console use systemfixed font on Win

	* generic/tkEntry.c: removed unnecessary ENTRY_VALIDATE #define

2000-04-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkRectOval.c (ConfigureRectOval): Added checks for valid
	outline settings before creating of outline GC; this means that it
	is really possible now to have an oval or rectangle with no
	outline.  [Bug: 5029].

2000-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/choosedir.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::chooseDir::Config):
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::Config): removed the
	extraneous glob on -initialdir after file isdir already returned 1
	and moved cd trick into this case as the else already uses [pwd].
	[Bug: 5181]

	* win/winMain.c: moved extern call out of WinMain func

	* README:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tk.spec:
	* win/configure.in: bumped to version 8.3.1

	* library/msgbox.tcl (tkMessageBox): changed to use grid in some
	places, realign icon to anchor nw.

	* mac/tkMacScale.c: reverted tkMacScale.c to 1.5 equivalent (it
	was accidentally bumped forward).

2000-04-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed Mod2Mask in TkWinGetModifierState to
	ALT_MASK, to fix some event problems [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

	* win/tkWinX.c: Changed Mod2Mask in GetState to ALT_MASK, to fix
	some event problems [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

	* generic/tkInt.h: Moved definition of ALT_MASK and META_MASK here
	so that it would be accessible from other modules than tkBind.c.

	* generic/tkBind.c: Added code in BindEvent to check for ALT_MASK
	and META_MASK in the event state field, as this field may not be
	set up with the correct display modifier mask bits if the XEvent
	structure was created by [event generate] or by the Windows X
	emulation. [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

2000-04-18  Scott Redman  <redman@HILO>

	* win/tk.rc:
	* win/wish.rc:
	* win/wish.ico:  Modified copyright dates in Windows resource
	files.  Updated the icon for wish.exe.

2000-04-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Added checks for visibility of parent window
	before creating MessageBox and ChooseColor dialogs; this prevents
	the application from locking when the parent is withdrawn and the
	message box is created.  In these cases, the window will be
	created without a parent.

	* unix/mkLinks: Added WinViewable.3.

	* tests/msgbox.test: Added tests for patch from [Bug: 4997].

	* library/msgbox.tcl: 
	* library/dialog.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4997]; detaches
	dialog window from parent if parent is not viewable.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Removed workaround from [Bug: 4370]; this
	is superceeded by patches to dialog.tcl.

	* generic/tkCmds.c: Changed WinfoObjCmd to use Tk_IsViewable
	function to determine visibility of windows instead of inlining
	the code.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: 
	* generic/tk.decls: Added Tk_IsViewable declaration.

2000-04-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Tweaked double-/triple-click selection;
	previously, anchor and insert marks were placed in unexpected
	locations following a double or triple click.  Now they are placed
	logically.  Also tweaked the extension of selection via
	shift-double-clicks so that it no longer selects the contiguous
	whitespace on the side of the selection opposite the
	double-click. [RFE: 4253].

	* doc/menu.n: Added note regarding rendering of
	checkbuttons/radiobuttons in menubars on different platforms --
	some systems do not draw indicators for check/radiobuttons in
	menubars.

	* library/menu.tcl: Corrected behavior of
	checkbuttons/commands/radiobuttons in menubars [Bug: 630].

	* tests/grid.test: Added test for [grid propagate . 0] to not toggle.
	
	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bogus logic in [grid propagate] that
	caused [grid propagate . 0] to act as a toggle instead of an
	absolute set. [Bug: 2286].

2000-04-16  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinColor.c (FindSystemColor): correct calculation of
	colors when shifting value. [Bug: 4919]

2000-04-16  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacPort.h: protect against strncasecmp already defined -
	it is in the Pro5 version of MSL.

	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c (GenerateKeyEvent): Check for a null tkWin.
	If the hidden window we use for double-buffering controls manages
	to percolate to the top (should never happen, but...) this will
	keep us from crashing.

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (InitSampleControls): Hide the
	double-buffering window BEHIND the first "." window you can find.
	This will keep it from ever being the front window, and thus a
	black hole for events.  * mac/tkMacButton.c (ButtonEventProc):
	Disable the controls when the window is in the background.  This
	is required by the MacOS HIG. This doesn't always get called when
	it should, it still needs more work.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: Pretty substantial rewrite to include
	Navigation Services support for systems which have it.

2000-04-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Added check for ASCII delete character in
	KeycodeToKeysym, to fix [Bug: 5090].  See comment in code for more
	information.

	* generic/ks_names.h: Added Scroll_Lock and Sys_Req definitions.

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Changed implementation of KeycodeToKeysym,
	et. al., to use a keycode table for lookups; this will result in
	faster keycode -> keysym translations for non-ASCII keys like
	Control, Alt, etc.

2000-04-14  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (WmProc): added check in WM_MOUSEACTIVATE so we
	correctly activate native menus when clicking in when we didn't
	have focus [Bug: 2272]

	* generic/tkCanvas.c (CanvasEventProc:2451): corrected cast

	* generic/tkEntry.c (Tk_EntryObjCmd): adjusted finishing error
	cases and changed TK_CONFIG_NULL_OK to TK_OPTION_NULL_OK

	* tests/scale.test:
	* generic/tkScale.c:
	* generic/tkScale.h:
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c:
	* mac/tkMacScale.c: moved (PixelToValue|ValueToPixel|SetScaleValue)
	to tkScale.c.  Caused an associated variable to be immediately set
	[Bug: 4833]

	* library/scale.tcl (tkScaleActivate): reduced number of scale
	redisplays by checking current value of state before setting it
	again.  [Bug: 4191]

	* tests/winDialog.test: tk_chooseDirectory seems to get a noop
	from GetOpenFileName in the static build, hanging some tests.
	The tests were fixed to timeout (noop cause unknown).

	* unix/aclocal.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): enhanced the detection of
	pthread_mutex_init [Bug: 4359] and (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS) added
	--enable-64bit-vis switch for Sparc VIS compilation [Bug: 4995]

2000-04-13  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Added smarts to check whether the left or right
	Control, Shift, or Alt key was pressed.  [Bug: 870].

	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Corrected code that created separator items on
	menus; originally, it requested that the system be responsible for
	drawing those items, so it would ignore configuration items like
	the widget background.  Now, we draw the separators ourselves (as
	we do with every other kind of menu item already). [Bug: 1166].

	* win/tkWin3d.c: 
	* unix/tkUnix3d.c: Applied patch from [RFE: 2501]: adds more
	sophisticated smarts to TkpGetShadows, so that the highlight of a
	very bright color is actually distinguishable from the color, and
	the shadow of a very dark color is similarly distinguishable from
	the color.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c: Applied patch from [Bug: 4202]; adds a check
	for NULL tkwin in Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw.

2000-04-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* test/winClipboard.test:
	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (UpdateClipboard):
	* win/tkWinX.c (GenerateXEvent): added updatingClipboard tsd and
	TkWinUpdatingClipboard accessor function to allow us to flag
	ourselves when we are the ones updating the clipboard.  This
	corrected inability to create our own clipboard types within a Tk
	application.  [Bug: 2338 4318]
	* win/tkWinTest.c (TestclipboardCmd): improved TestclipboardCmd
	with better error handling and obj'ification

2000-04-11  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* msgcat.n: Added docs for new behavior from patch in [Bug: 4158].

	* msgcat.test: Added tests for new behavior from patch in [Bug:
	4158].
	
	* msgcat.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4158], which enables
	msgcat::mc to search the entire namespace ancestry chain for
	message translations (ie, first it checks the current namespace,
	then the parent, then the parent's parent, etc).  Also allows the
	specification of additional args for msgcat::mc; if extra args are
	given, the [format] command is used to substitute the additional
	args in the translated message.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Moved check for withdrawn state after check
	for tkerror; this was causing problems when tkerror was used.

2000-04-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Added check for withdrawn state of . and
	unsetting of transient bit for .bgerrorDialog if . is not
	viewable; this protects against the application hanging on systems
	like Windows, where transient windows are withdrawn with their
	parents. [Bug: 4370].

	* tests/event.test: Added test for [event generate $widget
	<Alt-z>] [Bug: 4611].

	* tests/choosedir.test: Changed "namespace import ::tcltest" to
	"namespace import -force ::tcltest".

	* win/tkWinKey.c: 
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c: 
	* mac/tkMacKeyboard.c: Changed InitKeymapInfo to
	TkpInitKeymapInfo. [Bug: 4611].

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h: Re-gen'd from tkInt.decls.

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added TkpInitKeymapInfo to list of function
	decls.

	* generic/tkBind.c (HandleEventGenerate): Added code to initialize
	keymap info if necessary, and to correctly set modifier bits in
	XEvent structure create to handle [event generate] calls.
	Previously, the alt/meta bits were not set correctly, so [event
	generate $widget <Alt-z>] would always fail. [Bug: 4611]

2000-04-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkGrid.c (InitMasterData): fixed uninit'd data in
	GridMaster struct [Bug: 4387]

	* library/safetk.tcl (disallowTk): made disallowTk work in the
	simple case.

	* library/comdlg.tcl (tkFocusGroup_In): fixed key navigation
	problems in dialogs under CDE [Bug: 2960]

	* tests/winDialog.test: removed knownBug constraint from 5.16

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): corrected adjustment against
	LC_FACESIZE limitation for NT [Bug: 4931]

	* win/makefile.vc (TKTEST_OBJS):
	* win/Makefile.in (TKTEST_OBJS): moved tkWinTest.c from normal
	objs to TKTEST_OBJS where it belonged.

2000-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkTest.c: fixed incorrect platform inclusion for
	TkplatformtestInit (it would never get called).

	* unix/Makefile.in (MAN_INSTALL_DIR): patch to accept --mandir
	correctly [Bug: 4085]

	* library/clrpick.tcl (tkColorDialog_Config): error now thrown
	when -initialcolor "" specified. [Bug: 4198]

2000-03-31  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/DrawFocHlt.3: doc name correction

	* generic/tkEntry.c: set TK_OPTION_NULL_OK bit on -invcmd option
	and removed #ifdef ENTRY_VALIDATE expressions

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuInvoke): corrected naming of tearoffs
	[Bug: 4506]

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (tkIconList_Goto): caused browsecmd to be
	called in tkIconList_Select.  This causes the entry to be set
	properly when using the type-in-name-in-listbox bindings.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: added unicode-aware open/save file dialogs

	* win/tkWinFont.c (TkpFontPkgInit): move private ref to platformId
	to TkWinGetPlatformId

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (SetDefaults): moved private use of versionInfo
	to TkWinGetPlatformId and removed all code for
	(versionInfo.dwMajorVersion < 4) (== Win32s)

	* win/tkWinX.c:
	* win/tkWin32Dll.c: moved TkWinGetPlatformId to tkWinX.c
	* win/tkWinInit.c: added TkWinXInit to TkpInit to ensure that its
	called for static Windows shells. [Bug: 3647]

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinX.c:
	* win/tkWinDraw.c (SetUpGraphicsPort): 
	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c (UpdateScrollbar): removed use of tkpIsWin32s

	* win/tkWinInt.h (TkWinDCState struct): added bkmode value
	* win/tkWinDraw.c (TkWinGetDrawableDC, et al): added support for
	properly transparent dashed lines on Windows. [Bug: 4617]

2000-03-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Fixed some ANSI specific bits to avoid
	compile problems with non-ANSI compilers (ie, replace const with
	CONST, etc).  [Bug: 4223].

	* unix/configure.in: Applied patch from [Bug: 4237]; ensures that
	srcdir is fully qualified.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Applied patch from [Bug: 4237]; if tcltest was
	not compiled, make test/tktest failed.  Now it has a rule to build
	tcltest if it has not been built.

2000-03-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Moved an overlooked tkFDialog* function in
	::tk::dialog::file namespace.

	* tests/unixWm.test: Added tests for memory leak conditions in
	tkUnixWm.c.

	* tests/canvas.test: Added test for bad configuration options on
	empty and non-empty canvas.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c: Removed bad code in CANV_CONFIGURE block of
	CanvasWidgetCmd; this was causing non-empty canvases to improperly
	handle bad configuration options [Bug: 4456].

2000-03-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c: Applied patch from [Bug: 4405]; fixes memory
	leak in Unix wm command.

2000-03-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/filebox.test: 
	* tests/choosedir.test: Updated tests.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Updated to stash data array in
	::tk::dialog::file namespace instead of in global namespace.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Extended some functions to support creation
	of a choosedir dialog, to allow greater code reuse between the two
	dialogs.  Moved tkFDialog* functions into a namespace
	(::tk::dialog::file).  Because these are private Tk functions (and
	should thus not be used directly by users), this should not impact
	anybody (the tk_getOpenFile and tk_getSaveFile commands still
	exist at the global scope).

	* library/tk.tcl: 
	* library/tclIndex: Updated function names for tkFDialog*
	functions and choosedir functions.

	* library/choosedir.tcl: New and improved implementation of
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog.  Based on tk_getOpenFile dialog.

2000-03-23  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c: 
	* generic/tkInt.h: Updated Tcl_OptionCmd -> Tcl_OptionObjCmd

	* generic/tkOption.c: Tcl_Obj'ectified the "option" command.

2000-03-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/listbox.tcl (tkListboxCancel): Added a check for empty
	string value for tkPriv(listboxPrev).  Without this check, it's
	possible to get a stack trace under certain conditions. [Bug: 4373].

2000-03-15  Sven Delmas  <sven@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Changed the behavior for the
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog under Windows. Instead of trying to
	return the currently selected listbox entry (which didn't work in
	case the user selected the initial directory anyway), we now
	return the value shown in the entry. This seems to be in
	accordance with the expected behavior for this dialog.

2000-03-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/choosedir.test: Marked test 3.1 and 3.2 as bad until the
	issue with those tests on IRIX can be determined.

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4155]; protects
	against grabs on non-viewable windows.

2000-03-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/choosedir.test: Modified test 3.1 (-mustexist works) to be
	more careful about cleaning up its potentially troublesome after 
	events.

2000-03-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/button.test: 
	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -disabledforeground/-state to labels.

2000-03-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/entry.test:
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntrySetValue): malloc the value when
	validating because validation could cause the pointer to become
	invalid.  Also fixed configure to not trigger focus-based
	validation.  Improved use of Tcl_WrongNumArgs. [Bug: 4320]

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Added a check in tkMenuFirstEntry that changes
	menu behavior to only auto-post an immediate child cascade if we
	are currently on a menubar menu.  This prevents massive
	auto-cascading in cases where the first entry of the cascade is
	itself a cascade, and the first entry of that cascade is a
	cascade, and the first entry of that cascade is a cascade
	... [Bug: 676].

	* generic/tkOldConfig.c: Added check for NULL tkwin value in
	Tk_ConfigureWidget [Bug: 4079]

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Added check for NULL tkwin value in
	Tk_NameToWindow [Bug: 4079]

2000-03-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/color.test:
	* xlib/xcolors.c (XParseColor FindColor):
	* win/tkWinColor.c (XAllocColor): Fixed bit fiddling for colors to
	return "correct" values for color mapping. [Bug: 4282]

	* unix/Makefile.in (SCRIPT_INSTALL_DIR): removed extraneous '/'
	* unix/aclocal.m4: corrected TCL_NEEDS_EXP_FILE to be 1 for AIX

	* win/tkWinInt.h: change extern to EXTERN for TkWinChildProc
	declaration with extra #defs. [Bug: 4240]

	* library/focus.tcl: fixed tkFocusOK to protect $w in
	uplevel with list. [Bug: 4208]

	* doc/CrtItemType.3: fixed docs for Tk_CreateItemType to reflect
	changes made in 8.3.0 (but old style would still work as well).
	[Bug: 4252]

	* tests/config.test: extra test to check object cleanup when
	destroying the widget
	* generic/tkListbox.c (DestroyListbox): fixed crash in
	DestroyListbox due to null tkwin.  [Bug: 4207]

	* tests/entry.test: added test suite for entry validation
	* doc/entry.n: improved docs discussing caveats and gotchas when
	mixing textvar with widget validation
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntryValidateChange): improved handling of
	validation with relation to -textvariable.  Previously, it would
	turn off whenever the textvar was set.  Now it will it will turn
	off only when the textvar is set and validation returns 0.  Added
	%V (type of validation occuring) to %-subs to help work with
	trickier validation.

2000-03-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clrpick.test: 
	* library/clrpick.tcl: Added code to make color chooser dialog
	inherit screen setting from parent (bug #2334)

2000-02-25  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (RaiseWinWhenIdle): Checked for the possibility
	that the window could be destroyed (can occur with
	wm deiconify .toplevel; destroy .toplevel).

2000-02-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Applied "spirit of" the patch in 1605 (the
	submitted patch was more complicated than necessary and did not
	extend to writing GIF's, only reading), to allow reading/writing
	of GIF files on EBCDIC and other non-ASCII based systems.

2000-02-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tk.spec: RPM specification for producing a binary Tk RPM
	for Linux.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added rpm target to generate Tk
	binary RPM.

2000-02-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	8.3.0 RELEASE

	* changes: updated for 8.3.0 release

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (FileReadGIF): added cast for trashBuffer

	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: declared some Xlib emulation calls for
	the Mac

	* generic/tkFrame.c (TkInstallFrameMenu): added extra panic to
	inform user of bad call when framePtr is NULL [Bug: 2530]

	* generic/tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuInstance): Placed checks around
	menu name objects before trying to incr the ref.  [Bug: 3402]

	* generic/tkTest.c: removed USE_OLD_IMAGE def for Mac

	* library/listbox.tcl:
	* library/text.tcl: added support for <4> and <5> for mousewheel
	style scrolling on Unix for mice that map to these buttons.

	* tests/scrollbar.test: fixed check of testmetrics command to
	allow unix tests to run (testmetrics is mac/pc only)

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_CoordsToWindow): qualified delete of error
	handler as the goto label is reached from above and below.

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/aclocal.m4: cleaned up macros to coincide with tcl.m4,
	added -export-dynamic to LDFLAGS for FreeBSD-3+ [Bug: 2998]

	* unix/README:
	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): removed porting.notes and porting.old
	from distribution and CVS.  The information was very outdated.  Now
	refer to http://dev.scriptics.com/services/support/platforms.html

	* xlib/xgc.c: #def'd out XDrawSegments for the Mac, and added
	some extra include info for the Mac

2000-02-09  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacButton.c: Stop removing the appearance window from the
	Window List.  It is not clear why Ray did this, and it causes the
	Appearance manager to crash at random times.
	
	* mac/tkMacWM.c: Add support in unsupported1 style for the Appearance
	specification of window styles, including floating window support.
	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c: Operate on the front non-floating window,
	unless the mouse is directly over the floating window.  Also,
	keystrokes go to the front non-floating window.
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c: Initialize floating window support.
	* mac/tkMacScrlbr.c:
	* mac/tkMacmenu.c: Fixes for floating windows - operate on the 
	FrontNonFloatingWindow.
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r: Fix typo in File info string.
	* mac/tkMacApplication.r: Fix typo in file info string.  Add
	Finder balloon help for no apparent reason.
	
	* mac/tkMacSubwindows.c: Change panic in tkMacGetDrawablePort to
	Debugger.  This is only a temporary fix.  The panic is only
	triggered when a safeTk interpreter is torn down, and ignoring it
	does no harm.  I haven't figured out how to avoid it yet, however.
	Also use the Appearance MoveWindowStructure call when available.
	
	New Files:
	* MW_TkOldImageHeader.h: Handle #defining USE_OLD_IMAGE for tkImgPPM.c.
	* MW_TkTestHeader.h:
	* MW_TkTestHeader.pch:
	* MW_TkHeader.h: Add separate prefix files for test & release
	versions of Tk, so we can just have separate targets w/o having to
	edit files.
	
	* tclets.r: The D&D Tclets icon in rez form so we can have a
	target for this.

	The above are curtesy of Daniel Steffen (steffen@math.mq.edu.au)
	
	* tkMacAppearanceStubs.c: Stubs of the Mac Appearance calls I use
	so I can link the static 68K Shell without putting ifdef's all
	over the code.

	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tkBind.c:
	* generic/tkInt.decls:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* mac/tkMacKeyboard.c:
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c:
	* win/tkWinKey.c: Fix for keyboard handling of "dead" keys and
	caps lock from Peter Spjuth. [Bug: 4105 3359 2493]
	Split functions into platform specific files:
	Static functions GetKeySym(), SetKeycodeAndState() and InitKeymapInfo()
	from tkBind.c moved into platform files tkWinKey.c tkUnixKey.c and
	tkMacKeyboard.c.  GetKeySym() and SetKeycodeAndState() renamed to 
	Tkp* and made public (as private functions) in tkInt.decls.

	Step 2, fixes in tkWinKey.c
	New static function: KeycodeToKeysym(), based on XKeycodeToKeysym()
	but with different arguments, and a lot of improvements.
	TkpGetString() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym() + other fixes.
	TkpGetKeySym() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym() + other fixes.
	InitKeymapInfo() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym().
	TkpSetKeycodeAndState() rewritten, mostly by copying code from
	XKeysymToKeycode().
	XKeycodeToKeysym() rewritten. Preferably it should be removed.

	EXPLANATION: The main problem is ToAscii() which has a lot of side
	effects, and also that XKeycodeToKeysym() is not provided enough
	input to do a proper job.  The changes' main goal is to avoid
	calling ToAscii() if not necessary, and to provide it with as
	correct information as possible when called.  Also some attempts
	to clean up what ToAscii() did are done.  See the code for details.

	BUGS FIXED: Typing shifted (and AltGr) dead keys did not work.
	Keyboard lock lamps did not work on Win98.
	Events regarding AltGr-keys behaved badly.
	Example: On a Swedish keyboard, $ is typed with AltGr-4.
	That keyboard event would get the keysym '4' not 'dollar'.
	Also, doing [event generete . <Key-dollar>] would send keysym '4'.
	Translation to ascii in TkpGetString did not handle return and
	tab correctly. I.e. [event generate . <Key-Return>] gave wrong %A

	* generic/tkDecls.h:
	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tk.h: moved new public functions created in dash patch
	to the stubs interface [Bug: 4062]

	* generic/tk.h: 
	* doc/CrtImgType.3:
	* doc/CrtPhImgFmt.3:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* generic/tkImgGIF.c:

	* generic/tkStubImg.c (new file):
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: improved support for moving from the old style
	image C API to the new obj'ified one with new Tk_InitImageArgs
	command and stub'ing of image code.  See docs for how to make the
	transition. [Bug: 4060]

	* library/tk.tcl: wrapped check for tcl_platform(os) around info
	exists because it won't in safe interpreters

	* win/tkWinFont.c: corrected symbol font use to only work on 8-bit
	characters [Bug: 2406]

	* unix/aclocal.m4: changed all -fpic to -fPIC

	* README:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* generic/tk.h (TK_RELEASE_SERIAL): Moved to 8.3.0 patchlevel

2000-02-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Applied patch from bug #4117,
	tk_getOpenFile/getSaveFile doesn't do the right thing when user
	types a directory name in the entry and a default extension is
	specified.

2000-02-05  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixScale.c (TkpDestroyScale): changed ckfree to
	Tcl_EventuallyFree to behave with Tcl_Preserve in TkpDisplayScale
	(prevents possible segfault).

2000-02-03  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/canvText.test: test for fix for bug #2525.

	* generic/tkFont.c (Tk_ComputeTextLayout): Was erroneously setting
	the width of newline-only text display chunks to some arbitrary
	huge number, instead of 0; this was interfering with things like
	the canvas find enclosed feature. (bug #2525).

	* tests/text.test: 
	* generic/tkText.c (DumpLine/DumpSegment): Changed DumpSegment to
	take a TkTextIndex instead of two integer offsets, so that it
	could use TkTextPrintIndex to format the offsets into an index,
	which makes it UTF smart (bug #2582).

2000-02-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tk.tcl: 
	* library/tclIndex: 
	* library/choosedir.tcl: Moved choosedir functions into the
	::tk::dialog::chooseDir namespace instead of a toplevel
	::tkChooseDirectory namespace.  Additional cleanup on the
	chooseDir dialog.

2000-02-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/text.n: clarified docs on what happens during a search with
	-count when images/windows are embedded

	* win/tkWinPixmap.c (XGetGeometry): added support for windows in
	XGetGeometry [Bug: 4069]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): fixed possible mem overrun with
	long font names [Bug: 4108]

	assumption that (N+1)*delta = N*delta + delta with floating point
	math [Bug: 3689, 4099]
	(DestroyScale) Fixed check for cancelling TkpDisplayScale (was
	REDRAW_ALL, is now REDRAW_PENDING)

	* tests/listbox.test: corrected test case for listbox itemconfigure

	* unix/aclocal.m4: added *BSD ELF recognition for
	SHARED_LIB_SUFFIX determination (from Tcl's tcl.m4)

2000-01-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Removed unneccesary object translation in 
	MatchStringFormat (bug #4103).

2000-01-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Additional code cleanup (now we only have
	one decoder!  neat!)

2000-01-26  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: 
	* doc/chooseDirectory.n: Man page/cross links for

	Unix/Mac (bug #1786).

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Added some comments regarding slow
	processing of transparent images.

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Improved GIF decoder for ~60% speed
	increase.  Added some comments on how to further improve the
	implementation, time permitting.

	* doc/photo.n: Added a description of what the -data string can
	contain (base64 or binary data).

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Fixed bug with use of binary data for
	"-data" option to "image create" command.

2000-01-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Fixed bug relating to incorrect parent
	values for error message boxes displayed by the file dialog (bug
	#3616).

	* tests/text.test: 
	* generic/tkText.c: Fixed bug relating to regexp searching for
	empty lines; previously, the starting line was ignored. (bug #1643).

2000-01-20  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/text.tcl: fixed double-click selection behavior where
	there were embedded windows/widgets in the same line. [Bug: 3989]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (TkWmProtocolEventProc): cached atom name as the
	window could get destroyed during eval [Bug: 2513]

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c (LineCoords): fixed segfault when too few
	coords were passed to a line with certain options set (it should
	always have thrown an error anyway). [Bug: 4042]

	* tests/text.test:
	* generic/tkText.c: fixed missing " in error case and missing
	'dump' in subcommand listing [Bug: 4036]

	* generic/tkListbox.c: adjusted use of basic string concatenation
	in (non-K&R behavior) [Bug: 4027]
	Swapped bg/fg class for -select(bg|fg) for listbox and their
	items [Bug: 4039]

2000-01-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/grid.test: Added a test for the consecutive ^ and multiple
	widget case (bug #1386).

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed interpretation of consecutive ^
	characters in grid command.  Previously, ^ ^ was interpreted as
	meaning that there must be a 2-column widget above to extend,
	neglecting the case where there was actually 2 1-column widgets
	above.  Now, ^ ^ is interpreted as a possible width; the gridder
	will consume as many ^'s as there are columns in the widget, and
	leave the rest for the extension of other widgets.  (bug #1386).

2000-01-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tk.tcl: Created a virtual event <<PrevWindow>> for

	* TK 8.2.0 RELEASED

1999-08-13  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: Tk_DrawChars ends up setting the menu background
	wrong.	There is no clean way to stop it, so I use lower level routines
	here to draw the text.
	* mac/tkMacProjects.sea.hqx: Rearrange the projects so that the build 
	directory is separate from the sources.  Much more convenient! 

1999-08-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: changed "wm deiconify" on Windows to raise and
	force the focus on the deiconified window (behavioral change from
	8.1 to comply better with Windows style) [Bug: 1609]
	* doc/wm.n: clarified behavior of "wm deiconify".
	* generic/tkInt.decls: added TkSetFocusWin
	* generic/tkFocus.c: changed static SetFocus to TkSetFocusWin

	* library/clrpick.tcl:
	* library/console.tcl:
	* library/tk.tcl: fixed code where abbreviations where used
	in calling widget methods (confuses iWidgets) [Bug: 2422]

1999-08-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/button.tcl: cleaned up programming (config -> configure)
	and fixed Windows relief bug [Bug: 664]
	* library/entry.tcl: changed Entry C/C/P to not use global data
	(now uses tkPriv(data)) [Bug: 1475]
	* library/listbox.tcl: fixed extended mode script error [Bug: 866]
	* doc/options.n: clarified that -troughcolor doesn't work on Windows
	* doc/wm.n: fixed wm positionfrom docs [Bug: 2284]

1999-08-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* mac/tkMacPort.h: wrapped panic in #ifndef panic to avoid
	compiler errors when used with stubs-#defines, from Vince Darley.
	[Bug: 2389]
	
1999-07-31  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h: Remove XFillRectangle since it is now in the
	stub tables.

1999-07-30  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added stub entry for XFillRectangle [Bug: 2446]

1999-07-30    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Corrected building threaded tktest.exe on
	Windows.  Needed to link in .obj files from Tcl, needs to change
	later so that code is in Tk and doesn't require a Tcl build.
	Also added runtest target.

1999-07-29    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Allow tcl to open CON and NUL, even for std
	channels.  Checking for bad/unusable std channels was moved to Tk
	since its only purpose was to check whether to use the Tk Console
	Window for the std channels.  [Bug: 2393 2392 2209 2458]

	* win/Makefile.in: Corrected building threaded tktest.exe on
	Windows.  Needed to link in .obj files from Tcl, needs to change
	later so that code is in Tk and doesn't require a Tcl build.

1999-07-22    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* Changed version to 8.2b2

	* win/tkWinPort.h: Block out include of sys/stat.h in order to
	build extensions with MetroWerks compiler for Win32. [Bug: 2385]
	
	* unix/Makefile.in: Need to make install-sh executable before
	calling (with chmod +x).  [Bug: 2413]
	
	* library/menu.tcl: Applied patch from Jeff Hobbs to fix typo.
	[Bug: 2425]
	
1999-07-21    <redman@scriptics.com>

	for install-libraries.

	* unix/aclocal.m4: Check for Alpha/Linux to set the IEEE flag to
	the compiler to be -mieee.  Patch from Don Porter.

1999-07-08    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/unixSelect.test: Fixed broken test.

	* win/makefile.vc: Added special case target to ensure that 
	tkStubLib.obj is built with -DSTATIC_BUILD.

	* win/tkWinX.c (TkWinChildProc): Changed to pass
	WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED through to DefWindowProc to make OpenGL
	sub-windows happy.  This allows Windows to generate the WM_SIZE
	and WM_MOVE messages.

1999-07-08    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Fix Tk stub lib file names and flags.

1999-06-30    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: removed deprecated functions (applied patch
	from Jan Nijtmans). [Bug: 2080]

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c:
	* generic/tkImgPPM.c:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Applied patch to allow Img extension to
	work with 8.2, from Jan Nijtmans. [Bug: 2068]

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Applied patch from Don Porter to prevent the
	windows code from calling the Tcl functions when the stub table
	has not been initialized in TkWinWmCleanup.  [Bug: 2269]
	
1999-06-16    <wart@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/aclocal.m4: Numerous build changes to make Tk conform to
	the proposed TEA spec

	* tkConsole.c: changed some variable types from (int) to (size_t)
	to prevent compiler warnings.  Cast return value from strlen()
	to (int) in one place for the same reason.

1999-06-03    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: 
	* tests/unixSelect.test: 
	* generic/tkSelect.c: Fixed selection code to handle Unicode data
	in COMPOUND_TEXT and STRING selections. [Bug: 1791]

1999-06-02    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h: 
	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h: Added Mac specific defines to help with
	compilation. 

	* generic/tkFont.c: lint

1999-06-01    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Improved I18N selection support.
	COMPOUND_TEXT is converted to/from iso2022, and STRING is
	converted to/from iso8859-1.  There are still a few loose ends to
	tie up before this is completely done.

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Eliminated redundant case folding code.

	* generic/tkFont.c: Eliminated use of isupper/tolower in favor of
	Unicode variants.

1999-05-24    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: 
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:

	CF_LOCALE information (e.g. from command.com).

1999-05-20    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* library/console.tcl: Changed copyright string to read 1999
	Scriptics Corp. in wish console about box.
	
1999-05-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tk.h: Add extern "C" block around entire header file for
	C++ compilers to fix linkage issues.  Submitted by Don Porter and
	Paul Duffin.

1999-05-18    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/winClipboard.test: 
	* win/tkWinClipboard.c: Fixed clipboard code so it handles Unicode
	data properly on Windows NT and 95. [Bug: 1791]

1999-05-07    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Fixed bug where tk_popup fails when called too
	quickly. [Bug: 2009]

1999-04-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Changed version number to 8.1.1.

1999-04-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged changes from 8.1.0 branch:

	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: Changed to avoid the need for forward
	declarations in stub initializers.  Added extern "C" blocks around
	stub table pointer declarations so the stubs can be used from C++
	code. [Bug: 1934]

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added TkClipBox, XDrawSegments, and
	XForceScreenSaver to stubs.

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: Reordered declarations to avoid
	circularities and forward references.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: Added includes for Mac.

	* generic/tkMenubutton.c: lint

	* generic/tkEntry.c: Fixed bad option table entry.

	* generic/tkImgBmap.c:
	* generic/tkImgPPM.c:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Set the -translation and -encoding options
	to binary for image files. (reported by Marco Gazzetta)

	to binary for image files. (reported by Marco Gazzetta)

1999-04-20    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h: changed definition of Status type to use a
	typedef instead of a #define to avoid conflicting with the cygwin
	win32 headers [Bug 1804]

1999-04-15    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged 8.1 branch into the main trunk

1999-04-09    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Fixed deadlock situation when the Initialize()
	function returns without releasing the mutex.  Found while testing
	Bug 1700, during safe.test (tk).

1999-04-06    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_MainEx): Changed to reset result before
	calling Tcl_EvalFile.  The ensures that error messages will be
	generated cleanly.

	* tests/winfo.test: Enabled tests that previously failed.

1999-04-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* library/tk.tcl: Lots of minor performance improvements
	contributed by Jeffrey Hobbs. [Bug: 1118]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): Fixed bad code in tracing
	suboption. [Bug: 1519]

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Change to restore button text after an
	action to avoid the sticky "Open" button in a save dialog.
	[Bug: 1640]

	* library/entry.tcl: Fixed so selection is returned using the
	-show character during cut and paste operations. [Bug: 1687]
	
1999-04-5     <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkInt.decls:

	tables.
	
1999-04-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c: Added configure test for pw_gecos field in
	pwd to support OS/390. [Bug: 1724]

1999-04-02    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/text.test: 
	* generic/tkText.c: Fixed handling of Unicode in text searches.
	The -count option was returning byte counts instead of character
	counts. [Bug: 1056, 1148, 1666]

1999-04-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkWindow.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: Tk now uses its own stub library to store
	pointers to its own stubs table.

	* doc/dde.n: (removed)
	* doc/send.n:
	* generic/tk.decls:
	* tests/winSend.test:
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h:
	* win/tkWinSend.c:  Removed the DDE-based send and dde commands,
	they were causing Tk to lock up when any window on the system was
	not processing its message queue (more importantly, windows in Tcl
	and Tk).  The send command needs to be rewritten to prevent the
	deadlock situation (soon).  The dde command is being pushed into
	its own package and will provide almost all of the capabilities
	that send did before (using a "dde eval" command), not yet
	completed.

1999-03-31    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Modified dde/send code to work properly on
	Win95/Win98. String lengths are not returned properly by DDE, so
	NULL terminate all strings going in and ignore the string length
	coming back out.  Do not destroy handles until all necessary work
	on those handles (and child handles) is done.

1999-03-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): Image handlers are now
	finalized before the font subsystem since complex image handlers
	may contain references to fonts (e.g. Tix compound images).
	[Bug: 1603]

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: 
	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c: 
	* win/tkWinFont.c: 
	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Standardized text layout and font interfaces
	so they are consistent with respect to byte versus character
	oriented indices.  The layout functions all manipulate character
	oriented values while the lower level measurement functions all
	operate on byte oriented values.  This distinction was not clear
	and so the functions were being used improperly in a number of
	places.  [Bug: 1053, 747, 749, 1646]

	* generic/tk.decls: Eliminated uses of C++ STL types string and
	list from declarations.

	* generic/tkFont.c: Changes to named fonts were not being
	propagated in some cases. [Bug: 1144]
	
	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added XParseColor to xlib stub
	tables. [Bug: 1574] 

	* doc/GetBitmap.3: 
	* generic/tkBitmap.c (BitmapInit): Eliminated use of Tk_Uid's in
	bitmaps.  Added a few CONST declarations.

1999-03-29    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* generic/tkDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h: Removed stub functions. Always use the
	Tcl stubs when building with --enable-shared.
	

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkTextIndex.c:
	* tests/testIndex.test: Avoid looking past the beginning of the
	array storing data for the text widget (.t index end-2c).  Added
	test case to check for the bug.  [Bug 991]
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Copy static strings into a Tcl_DString
	before passing to Tcl_Eval, in case the compiler puts static
	strings into read-only memory.

1999-03-26    <suresh@scriptics.com>
	
	* unix/configure.in:
	--nameble-shared is now the default and builds Tk as a shared
	library; specify --disable-shared to build a static Tk library
	and shell.

1999-03-26    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Fixed bug reported by Bryan Oakley in the
	menubutton bindings.  There was a false assumption that there was
	always a menu attached to the button.  [Bug 1116] 

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Removed --enable-tcl-stub.  Linking Tk to Tcl
 	stubs is causing too many problems when linking executables like wish.
  	Until the Tk is a fully loadable extension, linking against the Tcl
 	stubs is not supported in Tk.

1999-03-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c:
	* generic/tkGC.c: When creating hash tables that key off of XID
 	handles, make sure to pass TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS.  XIDs are guaranteed
 	to be 32bit numbers, although on some 64bit systems (including 64bit
 	Solaris 7) they are packed into a 64bit value where the upper 32bits
 	are zero. The normal method of sizeof(XID)/sizeof(int) causes the
 	hash table code to assume that the XID is a pointer to an array of 
	two ints, which it is not.  Tk now supports 64bit Solaris 7.

1999-03-17    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: 
	* generic/tk.h: Changed to use TCL_BETA_RELEASE macro, and fixed
	so this works in rc files.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: 
	* win/makefile.bc: 
	* win/README: 
	* unix/configure.in: 
	* generic/tk.h:

1999-03-14    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/configure.in: Added missing stub related definitions.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Install tkDecls.h in addition to tk.h.

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: Added flags to ensure we are using Tcl
	stub macros.

1999-03-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added reserved slot for XSetDashes for use
	by the dash patch.

	* unix/tkUnix.c:
	* unix/tkUnix3d.c:
	* unix/tkUnixDraw.c:
	* unix/tkUnixFont.c:
	* unix/tkUnixMenubu.c: Stubs implementation for 8.1.  Tk_Main() is
	replaced with a macro which calls Tk_MainEx(). Tk can link to the Tcl
	stubs library, wish links directly to Tcl and Tk. Use
	--enable-tcl-stubs to link Tk to the Tcl stubs library (Unix), on
	by default on Windows. Exported all public functions through the
	stubs mechanism (see the *.decls files) and many of the internal
	functions. Most of the changes dealt with shifting around the
	function declarations in the header files.  Mac code may not
	compile, but it shouldn't take much work to fix this.
	
	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: Added dummy TkpMenuThreadInit for Mac to be
	consistent with Unix and Windows versions.
	
1999-03-08    <lfb@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Toplevel class no longer shared between 
	threads.
	
	* win/tkWinX.c: Multiple threads no longer share the same
	TkDisplay structure.  Required because TkDisplay stores much
	thread-specific data for a given thread.

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Moved application instance handle out
	out thread-local storage.  DDE was failing to initialize
	when the instance handles were different between threads.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Added THREADDEFINES for building with
	threads enabled.
	
	* generic/tkMenu.c:
	* win/tkWinMenu.c:
	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c: Added TkpMenuThreadInit for initializing
	thread-specific Menu state.

1999-03-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: 
	* win/tkWinPointer.c:
	* win/tkWinInt.h: Fix "focus -force" for Windows.  The Win32 API
	function SetForegroundWindow() does not work unless the window
	handle is a toplevel window (a Windows toplevel).  The handle
	being passed was a Tk toplevel, which is a child of the Windows
	toplevel.

1999-02-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/cat.c: Remove this file, use the one in the Tcl source directory.

	* win/makefile.vc: Remove the wishc.exe from the default targets.  Add
	a separate console-wish target to build it.  The need for a 
	console-wish will go away soon, so we don't want to encourage its
	use.

1999-02-25    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Properly initialize the tsdPtr->firstWindow field.
	
	* win/cat.c: Code for cat32.exe, copied from the Tcl sources. Required
	in order to run the test suite from the makefile

	* win/winMain.c: Add main() for a console-based wishc.exe, which meant
	adding code to disable the call to Tk_ConsoleInit().
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Check the standard handles before creating the
	new standard channels.	This allows a windows app that has stdin,
	stdout, or stderr to correctly connect to them.
	
	* generic/tkMain.c: Add a proper check for the interactive mode, since
	the standard channels may actually be connected in windows mode or
	even in the console-based wish.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Add targets for wishc.exe (console-based wish) and
	cat32.exe (for testing). Fix the test suite target so it can be run
	from the makefile (which can happen since the standard handles have
	been fixed).

1999-02-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* README:
	* generic/tk.h: 
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/README:
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc: Updated version to 8.1b2.
	
	* unix/tkUnixSend.c: Fixed one more Tcl_*ObjVar instance.
	
1999-02-04    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Various cleanup related to the Tcl_Eval and Tcl_ObjSetVar
	changes in Tcl.
	
	INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.5b2: 
	
	* win/tkWinMenu.c (TkpDestroyMenu): Changed so modalMenuPtr is
	cleared when it is being destroyed.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Changed so color tables are freed
	immediately instead of being delayed.  This ensures that color
	tables are properly disposed at process exit.

	* library/prolog.ps: Changed string that determines font height to
	include European character with an umlaut.

	* generic/tkImgBmap.c (ImgBmapConfigureInstance): If an image
	mask changed but ended up with the same XID, the GC failed to be
	updated and so the new mask was not used. [Bug: 970]

	* generic/tkFocus.c (SetFocus): Changed so focus window is always
	set if -force is specified.  This fixes the problem on Windows
	where Tk does not activate the window if it already has focus.

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Fixed so errors in console eval are
	reported properly.  Eliminated duplicate result messages. [Bug: 973]

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Changed so windows that aren't resizable don't
	have resize handles and the zoom box is disabled.

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed to cancel the mouse timer when a
	user initiated move/resize loop begins.

	* unix/configure.in: TK_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS was set incorrectly if
	SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}', and shared linking is performed through
	the C compiler. Systems affected are Linux, MP-RAS and NEXTSTEP,
	but also with gcc on many more systems. [Bug: 908]

	* win/makefile.vc: First stab at install target.  Fixed quoting so
	paths with spaces work.
	
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/unixWm.test: Better cleanup of temporary files.
	
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c:
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* generic/tkAppInit.c:
	* win/winMain.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern
	since they are not defining exported interfaces.  This avoids
	generating useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows
	makefile simpler.

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuFind): Changed so keyboard shortcuts
	will only be found in the current toplevel.  Previously, they
	might be found in menus attached to other toplevels that might not
	even be mapped. [Bug: 924]

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c: Changed to treat zero width lines like
	they have width 1 for purposes of selection. [Bug: 925]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (Tk_MeasureChars): Added a workaround for a bug
	in GetTextExtentExPoint on Win NT 4.0/Japanese. [Bug: 1006]

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Fixed uninitialized memory
	access bug. [Bug: 919]

1999-1-28    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bug in "grid forget" that failed to cancel
	pending idle handlers, resulting in a crash in a few odd cases.

1999-01-06  <lfb@JUSTICE>

	* generic/tk.h, generic/tkGet.c, generic/tkConfig.c, 
	* generic/tkOldConfig.c, generic/tkEntry.c, generic/tkMenubutton.c, 
	* generic/tkMenubutton.h, generic/tkScale.c, generic/tkScale.h, 
	* generic/tkTextDisplay.c, generic/tkText.c, unix/tkUnixMenubu.c, 
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c, mac/tkMacMenu.c, mac/tkMacMenubutton.c, 
	
	Removed global Tk_Uids dealing with "-state" configuration option
	and added new TK_CONFIG_STATE configSpec that doesn't use 
	Tk_Uids.

1998-12-11    === Tk 8.1b1 Release ===
	
1998-12-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_Main): Fixed improper command line encoding
	handling. 

1998-12-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (TkSelGetSelection, TkWinClipboardRender):
	Changed to handle multibyte characters properly. [Bug: 935]

1998-12-07    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/xmfbox.tcl (tkMotifFDialog_Create): In the cached case,
	the data array was not being initialized with the correct set of
	widgets.

1998-12-4    <welch@SAGE>

	* Changed patchLevel to 8.1b1

	* generic/tkMenu.c (ConfigureMenuCloneEntries): The -menu configuration
	option was being incorrectly specified as just "menu". 

1998-11-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): The error result was
	getting lost when restoring configuration options. [Bug: 619]

1998-11-25    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (GetFontAttributes): Initialize an unspecified
	family to an empty string.
	(FontMapLoadPage): if the font included characters below 32, the
	index computation was incorrect because the range was shifted up
	to 32.
	(CreateClosestFont): check for empty locale as well as NULL.

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontParseXLFD): initialize charset to
	iso8859-1 if no charset is specified.

	* mac/tkMacHLEvents.c (OdocHandler): added conversion from
	external string to UTF [Bug: 869]

	* integrated tk8.0.4 changes.
	
	* generic/tkBind.c: fixed deletion order bug where a crash would
	result if a binding deleted "."

	* generic/tkMenu.c (MenuWidgetObjCmd): disabled menu entries were
	getting reenabled whenever the mouse passed over the entry [Bug: 860]

	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c (TkpComputeStandardMenuGeometry): hidemargin
	option was not honored properly in menus [Bug: 859]

1998-11-24    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMacMenu.c, tkUnixMenu.c, tkWinMenu.c, tkMenuDraw.c, tkMenu.h,
	* tkMenu.c: Backed out the previous fix for bug 620 and
	eliminated a bunch of code that created unnecessary objects.
	Changed back to using internal types instead of objects for many
	configuration options.	There are many more fixes like this that
	could be made, but some require a little restructuring of the
	code. In any case the leaks are fixed and there is a lot less
	allocation happening. [Bug: 620]

1998-11-19    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuEntry): fixed memory leaks [Bug: 620]
	
	* tkWinX.c (GetTranslatedKey): fixed bad code merge

	* tkWinWm.c, tkWinMenu.c: fixed titles and menus so they properly
	display Unicode [Bug: 819]
