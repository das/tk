	* unix/configure.in:
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c: Added configure test for pw_gecos field in
	pwd to support OS/390. [Bug: 1724]

1999-04-02    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/text.test: 
	* generic/tkText.c: Fixed handling of Unicode in text searches.
	The -count option was returning byte counts instead of character
	counts. [Bug: 1056, 1148, 1666]

	* generic/tk.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkWindow.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: Tk now uses its own stub library to store
	pointers to its own stubs table.

	* doc/dde.n: (removed)
	* doc/send.n:
	* generic/tk.decls:
	* tests/winSend.test:
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h:
	* win/tkWinSend.c:  Removed the DDE-based send and dde commands,
	they were causing Tk to lock up when any window on the system was
	not processing its message queue (more importantly, windows in Tcl
	and Tk).  The send command needs to be rewritten to prevent the
	deadlock situation (soon).  The dde command is being pushed into
	its own package and will provide almost all of the capabilities
	that send did before (using a "dde eval" command), not yet
	completed.

1999-03-31    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Modified dde/send code to work properly on
	Win95/Win98. String lengths are not returned properly by DDE, so
	NULL terminate all strings going in and ignore the string length
	coming back out.  Do not destroy handles until all necessary work
	on those handles (and child handles) is done.

1999-03-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): Image handlers are now
	finalized before the font subsystem since complex image handlers
	may contain references to fonts (e.g. Tix compound images).

	* win/tkWinFont.c: 
	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Standardized text layout and font interfaces
	so they are consistent with respect to byte versus character
	oriented indices.  The layout functions all manipulate character
	oriented values while the lower level measurement functions all
	operate on byte oriented values.  This distinction was not clear
	and so the functions were being used improperly in a number of
	places.  [Bug: 1053, 747, 749, 1646]

	* generic/tk.decls: Eliminated uses of C++ STL types string and
	list from declarations.

	* generic/tkFont.c: Changes to named fonts were not being
	propagated in some cases. [Bug: 1144]
	
	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added XParseColor to xlib stub
	tables. [Bug: 1574] 

	* doc/GetBitmap.3: 
	* generic/tkBitmap.c (BitmapInit): Eliminated use of Tk_Uid's in
	bitmaps.  Added a few CONST declarations.

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkTextIndex.c:
	* tests/testIndex.test: Avoid looking past the beginning of the
	array storing data for the text widget (.t index end-2c).  Added
	test case to check for the bug.  [Bug 991]
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Copy static strings into a Tcl_DString
	before passing to Tcl_Eval, in case the compiler puts static
	strings into read-only memory.

1999-03-26    <suresh@scriptics.com>
	
	* unix/configure.in:
        --nameble-shared is now the default and builds Tk as a shared
        library; specify --disable-shared to build a static Tk library
        and shell.

1999-03-26    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Fixed bug reported by Bryan Oakley in the
	menubutton bindings.  There was a false assumption that there was
	always a menu attached to the button.  [Bug 1116] 

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Removed --enable-tcl-stub.  Linking Tk to Tcl
 	stubs is causing too many problems when linking executables like wish.
  	Until the Tk is a fully loadable extension, linking against the Tcl
 	stubs is not supported in Tk.

1999-03-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c:
	* generic/tkGC.c: When creating hash tables that key off of XID
 	handles, make sure to pass TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS.  XIDs are guaranteed
 	to be 32bit numbers, although on some 64bit systems (including 64bit
 	Solaris 7) they are packed into a 64bit value where the upper 32bits
 	are zero. The normal method of sizeof(XID)/sizeof(int) causes the
 	hash table code to assume that the XID is a pointer to an array of 
	two ints, which it is not.  Tk now supports 64bit Solaris 7.

1999-03-17    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: 
	* generic/tk.h: Changed to use TCL_BETA_RELEASE macro, and fixed

	* unix/configure.in: Added missing stub related definitions.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Install tkDecls.h in addition to tk.h.

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: Added flags to ensure we are using Tcl
	stub macros.

1999-03-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added reserved slot for XSetDashes for use
	by the dash patch.

	* unix/tkUnix3d.c:
	* unix/tkUnixDraw.c:
	* unix/tkUnixFont.c:
	* unix/tkUnixMenubu.c: Stubs implementation for 8.1.  Tk_Main() is
	replaced with a macro which calls Tk_MainEx(). Tk can link to the Tcl
	stubs library, wish links directly to Tcl and Tk. Use
	--enable-tcl-stubs to link Tk to the Tcl stubs library (Unix), on
	by default on Windows. Exported all public functions through the
	stubs mechanism (see the *.decls files) and many of the internal
	functions. Most of the changes dealt with shifting around the
	function declarations in the header files.  Mac code may not
	compile, but it shouldn't take much work to fix this.
	
	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: Added dummy TkpMenuThreadInit for Mac to be
	consistent with Unix and Windows versions.
	
1999-03-08    <lfb@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Toplevel class no longer shared between 
	threads.
	
	* win/tkWinX.c: Multiple threads no longer share the same
	TkDisplay structure.  Required because TkDisplay stores much
	thread-specific data for a given thread.

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Moved application instance handle out
	out thread-local storage.  DDE was failing to initialize
	when the instance handles were different between threads.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Added THREADDEFINES for building with
	threads enabled.
	
	* generic/tkMenu.c:
	* win/tkWinMenu.c:
	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c: Added TkpMenuThreadInit for initializing
	thread-specific Menu state.

1999-03-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: 
	* win/tkWinPointer.c:
	* win/tkWinInt.h: Fix "focus -force" for Windows.  The Win32 API
	function SetForegroundWindow() does not work unless the window
	handle is a toplevel window (a Windows toplevel).  The handle
	being passed was a Tk toplevel, which is a child of the Windows
	toplevel.

1999-02-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/cat.c: Remove this file, use the one in the Tcl source directory.

	* win/makefile.vc: Remove the wishc.exe from the default targets.  Add
	a separate console-wish target to build it.  The need for a 
	console-wish will go away soon, so we don't want to encourage its
	use.

1999-02-25    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Properly initialize the tsdPtr->firstWindow field.
	
	* win/cat.c: Code for cat32.exe, copied from the Tcl sources. Required
	in order to run the test suite from the makefile

	* win/winMain.c: Add main() for a console-based wishc.exe, which meant
	adding code to disable the call to Tk_ConsoleInit().
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Check the standard handles before creating the
	new standard channels.	This allows a windows app that has stdin,
	stdout, or stderr to correctly connect to them.
	
	* generic/tkMain.c: Add a proper check for the interactive mode, since
	the standard channels may actually be connected in windows mode or
	even in the console-based wish.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Add targets for wishc.exe (console-based wish) and
	cat32.exe (for testing). Fix the test suite target so it can be run
	from the makefile (which can happen since the standard handles have
	been fixed).

1999-02-12    <lfb@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkMenuButton.h:
	* generic/tkMenuButton.c:
	* mac/tkMacMenubutton.c:
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h
	* unix/tkUnixMenubu.c: Eliminated Tk_Uids used by -state option.

	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h:
	* unix/tkWinDefault.h:
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h:  Objectified scale widget.

	* win/tkWinX.c: Removed Thread-specific data from process
	initialization code that was stopping the Tk Dll from 
	loading.

1999-02-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* README:
	* generic/tk.h: 
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/README:
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc: Updated version to 8.1b2.
	
	* unix/tkUnixSend.c: Fixed one more Tcl_*ObjVar instance.
	
1999-02-04    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Various cleanup related to the Tcl_Eval and Tcl_ObjSetVar
	changes in Tcl.
	
	INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.5b2: 
	
	* win/tkWinMenu.c (TkpDestroyMenu): Changed so modalMenuPtr is
	cleared when it is being destroyed.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Changed so color tables are freed
	immediately instead of being delayed.  This ensures that color
	tables are properly disposed at process exit.

	* library/prolog.ps: Changed string that determines font height to
	include European character with an umlaut.

	* generic/tkImgBmap.c (ImgBmapConfigureInstance): If an image
	mask changed but ended up with the same XID, the GC failed to be
	updated and so the new mask was not used. [Bug: 970]

	* generic/tkFocus.c (SetFocus): Changed so focus window is always
	set if -force is specified.  This fixes the problem on Windows
	where Tk does not activate the window if it already has focus.

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Fixed so errors in console eval are
	reported properly.  Eliminated duplicate result messages. [Bug: 973]

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Changed so windows that aren't resizable don't
	have resize handles and the zoom box is disabled.

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed to cancel the mouse timer when a
	user initiated move/resize loop begins.

	* unix/configure.in: TK_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS was set incorrectly if
	SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}', and shared linking is performed through
	the C compiler. Systems affected are Linux, MP-RAS and NEXTSTEP,
	but also with gcc on many more systems. [Bug: 908]

	* win/makefile.vc: First stab at install target.  Fixed quoting so
	paths with spaces work.
	
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/unixWm.test: Better cleanup of temporary files.
	
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c:
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* generic/tkAppInit.c:
	* win/winMain.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern
	since they are not defining exported interfaces.  This avoids
	generating useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows
	makefile simpler.

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuFind): Changed so keyboard shortcuts
	will only be found in the current toplevel.  Previously, they
	might be found in menus attached to other toplevels that might not
	even be mapped. [Bug: 924]

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c: Changed to treat zero width lines like
	they have width 1 for purposes of selection. [Bug: 925]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (Tk_MeasureChars): Added a workaround for a bug
	in GetTextExtentExPoint on Win NT 4.0/Japanese. [Bug: 1006]

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Fixed uninitialized memory
	access bug. [Bug: 919]

1999-1-28    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bug in "grid forget" that failed to cancel
	pending idle handlers, resulting in a crash in a few odd cases.

1999-01-06  <lfb@JUSTICE>

	* generic/tk.h, generic/tkGet.c, generic/tkConfig.c, 
	* generic/tkOldConfig.c, generic/tkEntry.c, generic/tkMenubutton.c, 
	* generic/tkMenubutton.h, generic/tkScale.c, generic/tkScale.h, 
	* generic/tkTextDisplay.c, generic/tkText.c, unix/tkUnixMenubu.c, 
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c, mac/tkMacMenu.c, mac/tkMacMenubutton.c, 
	
	Removed global Tk_Uids dealing with "-state" configuration option
	and added new TK_CONFIG_STATE configSpec that doesn't use 
	Tk_Uids.

1998-12-11    === Tk 8.1b1 Release ===
	
1998-12-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_Main): Fixed improper command line encoding
	handling. 

1998-12-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (TkSelGetSelection, TkWinClipboardRender):
	Changed to handle multibyte characters properly. [Bug: 935]

1998-12-07    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/xmfbox.tcl (tkMotifFDialog_Create): In the cached case,
	the data array was not being initialized with the correct set of
	widgets.

1998-12-4    <welch@SAGE>

	* Changed patchLevel to 8.1b1

	* generic/tkMenu.c (ConfigureMenuCloneEntries): The -menu configuration
	option was being incorrectly specified as just "menu". 

1998-11-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): The error result was
	getting lost when restoring configuration options. [Bug: 619]

1998-11-25    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (GetFontAttributes): Initialize an unspecified
	family to an empty string.
	(FontMapLoadPage): if the font included characters below 32, the
	index computation was incorrect because the range was shifted up
	to 32.
	(CreateClosestFont): check for empty locale as well as NULL.

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontParseXLFD): initialize charset to
	iso8859-1 if no charset is specified.

	* mac/tkMacHLEvents.c (OdocHandler): added conversion from
	external string to UTF [Bug: 869]

	* integrated tk8.0.4 changes.
	
	* generic/tkBind.c: fixed deletion order bug where a crash would
	result if a binding deleted "."

	* generic/tkMenu.c (MenuWidgetObjCmd): disabled menu entries were
	getting reenabled whenever the mouse passed over the entry [Bug: 860]

	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c (TkpComputeStandardMenuGeometry): hidemargin
	option was not honored properly in menus [Bug: 859]

1998-11-24    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMacMenu.c, tkUnixMenu.c, tkWinMenu.c, tkMenuDraw.c, tkMenu.h,
	* tkMenu.c: Backed out the previous fix for bug 620 and
	eliminated a bunch of code that created unnecessary objects.
	Changed back to using internal types instead of objects for many
	configuration options.	There are many more fixes like this that
	could be made, but some require a little restructuring of the
	code. In any case the leaks are fixed and there is a lot less
	allocation happening. [Bug: 620]

1998-11-19    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuEntry): fixed memory leaks [Bug: 620]
	
	* tkWinX.c (GetTranslatedKey): fixed bad code merge

	* tkWinWm.c, tkWinMenu.c: fixed titles and menus so they properly
	display Unicode [Bug: 819]
