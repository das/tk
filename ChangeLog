	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bug in "grid forget" that failed to cancel
	pending idle handlers, resulting in a crash in a few odd cases.

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (TkpGetNativeFont): On some X servers,
	XQueryLoadFont will always return a font, even if the name is
	meaningless.  This prevents Tk from parsing the font name, so now
	we perform a quick sanity check on the name before letting X have
	it.  [Bug: 846]
