	* Merged changes from 8.0.5:
	    - Updated for Mac release
	
1999-03-22    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Removed --enable-tcl-stub from configure
 	scripts.  Due to linking problems with wish and potentially anyone
 	else linking directly to Tk, linking Tk to the Tcl stubs is being
 	disabled until Tk is a truly loadable extension.

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added reserved slot for XSetDashes for use
	by the dash patch.

1999-03-10    <redman@scriptics.com>
	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinPointer.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c: Fixed bug with "focus -force".  Windows'
	SetForegroundWindow doesn't work properly if you don't pass the
	handle to the true toplevel window.  Added a wrapper function
	TkWinSetForegroundWindow to work around the problem.  Back-ported
	from Tk 8.1.

	* unix/tkUnix3d.c:
	* unix/tkUnixDraw.c:
	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Stubs implementation for 8.0.6.  Tk_Main() is
	now a wrapper around Tk_MainEx() and will be removed in 8.1 and
	replaced with a macro.  Tk does not link to the Tcl stubs library
	for now, because of issues with wish (will be fixed in 8.1).
	Exported all public functions through the stubs mechanism (see the
	*.decls files) and many of the internal functions. Most of the
	changes dealt with shifting around the function declarations in
	the header files.  Mac code may not compile, but it shouldn't take
	much work to fix this.

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (TkpDestroyMenu): Changed so modalMenuPtr is
	cleared when it is being destroyed.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Changed so color tables are freed
	immediately instead of being delayed.  This ensures that color
	tables are properly disposed at process exit.

	* library/prolog.ps: Changed string that determines font height to
	include European character with an umlaut.

	* generic/tkImgBmap.c (ImgBmapConfigureInstance): If an image
	mask changed but ended up with the same XID, the GC failed to be
	updated and so the new mask was not used. [Bug: 970]

	* generic/tkFocus.c (SetFocus): Changed o focus window is always
	set if -force is specified.  This fixes the problem on Windows
	where Tk does not activate the window if it already has focus.

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Fixed so errors in console eval are
	reported properly.  Eliminated duplicate result messages. [Bug: 973]

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Changed so windows that aren't resizable don't
	have resize handles and the zoom box is disabled.

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed to cancel the mouse timer when a
	user initiated move/resize loop begins.

	* unix/configure.in: TK_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS was set incorrectly if
	SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}', and shared linking is performed through
	the C compiler. Systems affected are Linux, MP-RAS and NEXTSTEP,
	but also with gcc on many more systems. [Bug: 908]

	* win/makefile.vc: First stab at install target.  Fixed quoting so
	paths with spaces work.
	
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/unixWm.test: Better cleanup of temporary files.
	
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c:
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* generic/tkAppInit.c:
	* win/winMain.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern
	since they are not defining exported interfaces.  This avoids
	generating useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows
	makefile simpler.

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuFind): Changed so keyboard shortcuts
	will only be found in the current toplevel.  Previously, they
	might be found in menus attached to other toplevels that might not
	even be mapped. [Bug: 924]

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c: Changed to treat zero width lines like
	they have width 1 for purposes of selection. [Bug: 925]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (Tk_MeasureChars): Added a workaround for a bug
	in GetTextExtentExPoint on Win NT 4.0/Japanese. [Bug: 1006]

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Fixed uninitialized memory
	access bug. [Bug: 919]

1998-12-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bug in "grid forget" that failed to cancel
	pending idle handlers, resulting in a crash in a few odd cases.

1998-11-24    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (TkpGetNativeFont): On some X servers,
	XQueryLoadFont will always return a font, even if the name is
	meaningless.  This prevents Tk from parsing the font name, so now
	we perform a quick sanity check on the name before letting X have
	it.  [Bug: 846]
